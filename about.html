            <p>Hi, I'm EJ Sijera, a freelance photographer based in Iloilo city. My love for photography started when I was in elementary, and since then, l've been dedicated to capturing the beauty in the world through my lens. I specialize in lifestyle, fashion and portrait photography, with a focus on editorial and lifestyle shoot. My passion lies in telling stories through images, whether it's capturing the raw emotion of a moment or the intricate details of a scene. I strive to create timeless photos that evoke emotion and leave a lasting impression. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with brands and high profile clients and have honed my skills in studio and natural environment work. I'm committed to continuously evolving my craft and ensuring every project exceeds my client's expectations. My approach to photography is all about collaboration. I believe in creating a relaxed environment that allows my subjects to feel comfortable and authentic. Whether it's a photoshoot for a couple, a family, or a brand, I work closely with my clients to bring their vision to life while staying true to my artistic style. I'm always looking for new creative projects and would love to collaborate with you. Feel free to reach out, and let's create something beautiful together!</p>
